## Thoughts now

I’ve tried to excel here so many times in the past, producing no sustainable methodology. What’s different now is I have Generative AI.

My hero Tom Chi promotes “optimizing feedback loop length,” and that’s exactly the measurement for the success of this project.

First I need to draft the critical, essential steps of a sort of Minimum Viable Workflow for capturing the soul of an idea in a way that dignifies that idea, publishing it, inviting people into it, and managing that fleet of emotional connections.

## Random idea: “one minute dash”

Enumerate as many ideas still bothering the brain in 60 seconds:

Example:

- just.bible only now with GPT
- church finder
- ship.fun
- moona @ $5k/mo vs. $5k/wk vs. $5k=day

[insert gone in 60 seconds meme here]

How might we short circuit getting a (not the) dignified, fully self-expressed glimpse of this in front of an audience?

Then how do we move swiftly from there? Iterate, ship, learn.

## GPT-4, what are some idioms involving ships and all ships raising with the tide and how might I tie that creatively to innovative behavior?

Sure, there are many idioms and sayings involving ships and the sea. Let's see how we can use these creatively to discuss innovative behavior.

- **"A rising tide lifts all boats."** - This is often used to suggest that improvements in the general economy will benefit all participants in that economy. When applied to innovation, it can mean that when an industry or company innovates, everyone benefits. It challenges individuals and organizations to raise the tide through their own innovative contributions.
- **"Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors."** - This implies that adversity or struggle is necessary for learning and growing. In terms of innovation, it suggests that the most significant breakthroughs often come from overcoming obstacles, not from sailing smoothly.
- **"Ships are safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are built for."** - This is a call to take risks and venture out. In the context of innovation, it encourages individuals or companies to step outside their comfort zone and explore new opportunities.
- **"Loose lips sink ships."** - Originally a slogan during World War II to discourage careless talk that might reveal strategic information to the enemy. In the context of innovation, it could be taken to mean that ideas and strategies should be well protected and shared judiciously. However, it could also be a reminder that transparent communication and open collaboration often lead to the most successful innovations.
- **"You can't change the direction of the wind, but you can adjust your sails."** - This emphasizes adaptability. For innovation, this suggests the importance of being able to pivot quickly, respond to new information, and continuously seek better solutions.

In all, the key is to remember that innovation often requires risk-taking, adaptability, and the willingness to venture into uncharted waters. The tide of innovation will raise all involved, but the challenges faced along the way are what truly build a skillful and resilient crew.

## Aside

I like this process of entertaining myself as I embark on something very personal, vulnerable, and fraught with reminders of past difficulty.

I’m probably doing this to avoid the pain of the real work for as long as my integrity is willing to look the other way, or gifting grace maybe.

Almost there I think. We’ll see.

## GPT-4, help me write a succinct idea that expresses the power of the now, being in the moment, and that as nice as things like longevity and strategy are important, there is something very special about working quickly in the moment to capture all the complex fleeting components to bringing an idea to life and trusting your instincts.

> Embrace the electric vitality of “now.” While strategy charts the course and longevity sails the distance, there’s a unique, ephemeral magic in harnessing the fleeting complexities of the present moment. It’s in this charged immediacy where instinct meets opportunity, transforming nebulous ideas into tangible reality. Trust this instinct, this visceral wisdom that sparks innovation. The power of now is a catalyst, turning the cogs of creation with a speed that outpaces time, etching the essence of fleeting thoughts into the annals of achievement.

## Version now.0

A weird, no-too-serious behavior draft:

1. A way to catalog and distinguish the idea
2. Put in Firebase
3. Link to site
4. A video at some point
5. Some Gen AI wizardry
6. Some interesting design element or vibe

A draft of technical things:

- Ultralight repo
- index.html
- Painless to read/write Firebase
- Start by deploying to Pages
- Eventually move to modular SSG stack e.g. Nextjs 13 ∫ Vercel

Evidence this has legs: [bigfoot.city](https://bigfoot.city)
